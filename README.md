# CO2emissions Dataset from 1850-2021
## Description: Through the investigation, I was able to analyze the trends in the top 10 emitters in the world over the last 50 years, using coding to sort and display the data clearly. After the investigation, I've found that there has been a slight steady increase in the CO2 emmissions by the top 10 emitters. 
## Requirements: Google COLAB
## Data: This data was downloaded from Our World in Data on 03/29/23. The data displays the information for co2emissions from countries around the world. We will use this data to show the distribution of greenhouse gases emitted from various countries and analyze the data through graphs and statistical analysis.

## Data Processing: To clean up the data, I sorted the values by year and co2 emissions. Then I was able to get a list of the top 10 emitters between 1971-2020 and I defined the list as "top_ten_emitters".
